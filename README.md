#The Iron Yard Job Hunt

This project is for Iron Yard graduates ready to start the hunt for their new careers!
Until config component is done, you will still need to manually input a comment to your campus directors in the makeCard function and uncomment that code to make that happen!

### What you need to use this project:
- Trello
- Campus Director information
- Account with Dice.com

### How to get this project started:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:bam1056/reactIntegration.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Happy hunting, Iron grads!
